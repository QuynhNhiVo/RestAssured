# API Automation Testing with Rest Assured using Java

This repository contains code examples and resources for the "API Automation Testing with Rest Assured using Java" course by AnhTester. This course is designed to teach how to effectively automate API testing using the Rest Assured library in Java.

## Course Overview

* Course Title: Introduction to API Automation Testing with Rest Assured
* Instructor: AnhTester
* Course URL: https://anhtester.com/course/introduction-to-api-automation-testing-with-rest-assured
* 
## Technologies Used

* Java: Programming language used for the project.
* Maven: Build automation tool and dependency management.
* IntelliJ IDEA: Integrated Development Environment for Java.
* Rest Assured: Library for testing and validating REST services.
* TestNG: Testing framework for running test cases and managing reports.
* JSON: Data format for request and response handling.
* Lombok: Java library to simplify POJO class creation with annotations.
* DataFaker: Library for generating randomized test data.
* Log4j: Logging library for generating logs during test execution.
* Allure: Framework for generating detailed and interactive test reports.

## Features

* HTTP Methods: Utilizes GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE methods for API operations.
* Assertions: Validates JSON data using assertions.
* POJO Classes: Constructs data structures using Lombok for simplified management.
* Data Generation: Generates random test data using DataFaker.
* Parallel Execution: Runs test cases concurrently for faster execution.
* Logging: Logs test execution details using Log4j.
* Report Generation: Generates detailed test reports using Allure

## Description

This repository contains example code and resources to complement the course materials. I will learn:

* Know how to use Maven projects and IntelliJ IDEA.
* Use REST Assured for GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE operations.
* Use TestNG Framework to run test cases.
* Use a library to read test data from JSON.
* Verify data from JSON using Assertions.
* Build data in POJO class builder format with Lombok.
* Generate random test data with DataFaker.
* Run test cases in parallel (parallel execution).
* Export a report after running tests with Allure report.
* Log during test execution using the Log4j library.
